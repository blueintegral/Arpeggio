Arpeggio
========

A new way to compose music.

This is yet another experiment to figure out a better way to write music. Most people can hear a song in their head,
either that they've made up or heard before, but can't reproduce it on paper because they don't know music theory
or the rules for representing music in the classical way. Arpeggio tries to solve this.

The only way to tell if an idea is good or bad is to build it.


###Technologies
Arpeggio is all client side so far. It's based on Bootstrap and uses jQuery, grid.js, and Audiolet for sound synthesis.
